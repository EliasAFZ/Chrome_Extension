# Impulse_Extension
This chrome extension was inspired by the current extension [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) I had used the plug in for so long and wanted to take a crack at making a smaller version of it on my own. Currently it stores users that enter a name in a cookie along with a quote and background just for them (quote/background image expire after an hour and new ones are retrieved).
