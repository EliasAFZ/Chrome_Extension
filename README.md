# Chrome_Extension

# Description of plug in
This plug in was inspired by the current chrome plug in [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) I wanted to expore web dev a bit and take a crack at making a smaller version of it on my own. Currently it stores users that enter a name in a cookie along with a quote and background just for them (quoe/background image expire after an hour and new ones are retrieved).
